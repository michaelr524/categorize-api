# Java 8 Implementation Guidelines

## 1. Use Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces
- Utilize lambda expressions for more concise and readable code.
- Make use of functional interfaces like Predicate, Function, and Consumer.

## 2. Leverage the Stream API
- Use streams for processing collections of objects.
- Prefer stream operations (map, filter, reduce) over imperative-style loops.

## 3. Optional for Null Handling
- Use Optional<T> to represent nullable return types.
- Avoid returning null; instead, return Optional.empty().

## 4. Default and Static Methods in Interfaces
- Use default methods to add new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
- Utilize static methods in interfaces for utility functions related to the interface.

## 5. New Date and Time API
- Use the java.time package for date and time operations.
- Avoid using the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes.

## 6. Method References
- Use method references (::) where applicable to make code more readable.

## 7. Try-With-Resources for Resource Management
- Use try-with-resources statement for automatic resource management.

## 8. Diamond Operator for Generic Instance Creation
- Use the diamond operator <> to reduce verbosity in generic class instantiation.

## 9. Base64 Encoding and Decoding
- Use the java.util.Base64 class for Base64 encoding and decoding.

## 10. Prefer Composition Over Inheritance
- Use composition and interfaces to create flexible designs.

## 11. Immutability
- Make classes immutable when possible for thread-safety and simpler reasoning about state.

## 12. Docstrings for Classes and Methods
- Every class and method should have a succinct docstring.
- Docstrings should briefly describe the purpose and functionality of the class or method.

Remember to always prioritize code readability, maintainability, and performance when implementing these guidelines.
